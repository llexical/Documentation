# Django - Snippets

These are small scripts I have written for myself to solve a particular issue and I thought it worth saving them.

- Django Admin
    - [Add author on save](admin_add_author_on_save.py)
    - [Admin for model with foreign key parent](admin_model_foreign_key_parent.py)
- Django Model
    - [Model with soft delete](model_with_softdelete.py)

# Rust Documentation [&#128279;](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

My own personal documentation, written mainly for my own use to help me remember what I have read.

All of these notes come from [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and are just shortened versions or bullet points of what has been written. I have taken nearlly all code examples from the Rust book and do not claim ownership of any of what I have written.

# Documentation

My own personal documentation of different languages and frameworks, most of these notes have been written directly from other sources and I have just simplified it down or turned it into bullet points.

I don't claim ownership of any of what I have written and will include links to reference the source on most, if not all, pages.

I doubt anyone will read this, however if you do and spot something incorrect or that could be explained better feel free to submit a PR and I will review to add into the repo!
